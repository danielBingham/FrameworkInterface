===================
Framework Interface
===================

This is an experimental set of interfaces and drivers that will, in theory,
allow software to be written with the assumption of an underlying MVC PHP
Framework and then, using the drivers and interfaces as an adapter, placed
on top of any Framework for which drivers have been written in a plug and
play manner.  The only code that will need to be written for each project
built on top of the interfaces is the drivers.

This is completely experimental.  I have no idea if this is really feasable.  
That's why were here :D
